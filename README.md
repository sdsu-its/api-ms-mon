### Global Variables

In the API documentation, several "global" variables will be used to simplify the documentation, and make it more applicable to your use case.

* `API_ROOT` - The URL of the api folder in your instance of the Video Inventory Management System. If you are deploying to a default Tomcat container with the default context, the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/ms-mon`.
* `JSESSION` - After the Login process is completed, all requests need to include the Session Token, which is obtained during the authentication process. This is that token. This token authenticates you with the API and provides information to the API about you, the user.
* `success` - the jQuery function that is executed once the request is successful.
